## Description
This application is ment to help the user  to be able to determine what type of triangle he/she is dealing with.
The application help the user to distinguise the difference between equilateral triangle,scalene triangle and isoscelece triangle.
The aplication archives this by looking at the relationship between the size in length of the triangles.
For instance is the user has three value trianglur sides with two equal values the user is alerted isoscelece triange,while if all the sides are equal the user is alerted equilateral.
try out the application to enjoy .
The aplication is also able to disqualify values that can not form a triangle.



## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Git clone https://github.com/vincentouma/triangle-tracker-project.git
* Open the the the programm in a code editor of yuor choice.
* open the index.html in a browser 
* Folow instruction to use the application.


## Known Bugs
No known bugs currently but potential bug are welcome to be reported.



## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScripts



## Behavior driven development.

* The application should only accept numbers not strings if input data is string the output alerts enter a number.
 * Application behavior allow only values >0, if values input is <=0 ,output alerts not a triangle.
 * Application behavior allow equal values,if input values are equal,out put allerts equilateral triangle.
 * Application allows two value out of three to be equal  but there sum must greater than the other value,if input is true then the output allerts isosceles triangle.
 * application allow both values to be different ,if the input is true then the out put allerts scalene triangle.






 Behavior
input
output
1.Blank form
No number keyed in
Alert enter value
2.Value keyed in <=0
Key in value <=0
 Alert not a triangle
3.Number keyed in should be equal
Value keyed in are equal
 Alert equilateral triangle
4.Any two sides must be equal
Two values keyed in out of three are equal.
Isosceles triangle
5.Both three sides must not be equal.
Three keyed in values are not equal.
Scalene triangle
6.Sum of two sides must be >= one side.
Value keyed in sum of any two sides is >=0
Triangle cant be formed.
7.All sides must be >0
Value keyed in is <0
Not a triangle.
